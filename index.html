  <h1>About Me: Numbers, People, and Purpose</h1>

  <h2>From...Banking in Nigeria</h2>
  <p>
    For nearly a decade, I worked as a Funds Transfer Officer in the banking sector in Nigeria. During those years, I honed my skills in accuracy, efficiency, and managing complex transactions under tight timelines. Banking taught me the importance of trust, attention to detail, and the impact that reliable systems and data integrity have on peopleâ€™s lives.

  <h2>To...Public Service in the NHS</h2>
  <p>
    Since moving to the UK in 2022, I have been working as a Clinical Support Worker with the NHS. This period has been deeply meaningful to me. It has taught me compassion, patience, and a profound understanding of human vulnerability and resilience. Supporting individuals in their daily lives has given me a renewed sense of purpose and humility.
  </p>

  <h2>And Now...Pursuing Data Analytics with Imperial College</h2>
  <p>
    Today, I am studying Data Analytics with Imperial College to transition into a career where I can combine my banking experience and people-centred perspective with analytical skills. I want to support organisations to make informed decisions backed by data, improve processes, and create solutions that genuinely impact lives.
  </p>

  <h2>My Goal!</h2>
  <p>
    My goal is to become a data analyst who not only understands numbers and patterns but also sees the stories behind them, and uses these insights to drive meaningful change.
